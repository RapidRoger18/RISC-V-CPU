# How To Flash on Beagle Wire using Yosys tools

### Building Verilog frontend to json file
#### In rtl directory
```bash
	yosys
```
#### In Yosys Environment run the following commands
```yosys
	read_verilog {names of all modules included in project design}
	hierarchy -check -top top
	opt_expr
	opt_clean
	check
	fsm
	synth_ice40 -top {name of top module} -json {name of json file to be build}
```
* These commands will show the hierarchy of the top module and optimizes the design by removing unused warnings.
* Check command will show all possible warnings and errors.
* fsm command detects finite state machines in the design.
* synth_ice40 command will sythesize the design according to available resources on ice40 FPGA into a json file. This will be used by next pnr for placing and routing.

#### Additional commands
* If synth command fails with ` ($DLATCH_P_) not supported ` or ` ($DLATCH_N_) not supported  ` error use following command before using synth command.
```yosys
	techmap -map test_map.v
	techmap -map test_map_2.v
	simplemap
```
* You can execute synth_ice40 command after this.

### Placement and Routing using Nextpnr
```bash
	nextpnr-ice40 --json {name of json file created in yosys} --pcf {name of pcf constraints file} --asc {name of asc file to be created}
```
### Generating Bitstream file
```bash

```
